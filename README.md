# Gesture-Recognition

This Project is based on the project [RT_GestureRecognition](https://github.com/fabiopk/RT_GestureRecognition) by @fabiopk and has been developed further in Ubuntu. Some libraries are Ubuntu specific and might not work in windows. Some of the functioning of the original model has been altered for the purposes of this project. You can check out this [video](https://youtu.be/5vxY9YvVFOA) to see a working model and another [video](https://youtu.be/QeCFtiAfA1o) that shows another possible application of this project.

# Getting the demo to work:

Clone the repository.
You might need to install some libs such as:

- PyTorch
- OpenCV2
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Torchvision
- PyautoGUI

Run `demo.py`

Press `Q` to stop.

# TO DO:

- Repurpose commands for more vital tasks
- Build the project with libraries that work with windows.

Special thanks to @fabiopk for providing the model used here.
